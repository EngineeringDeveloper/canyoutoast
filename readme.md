# Can you Toast?

_Web App which links with Strava to estimate your performance based on how well you can toast bread_

... Thats it

## Ideas

- Strava integration
- Toast pops out of a toaster
- SSR for sharing

## Tooling

SvelteKit

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open

# To create a production version of your app:
npm run build

# You can preview the production build with 
npm run preview
```
